symbolic edges:
Denote the points as 0 through n-1

Start with a fixed number of m edges
For the ith edge edge, create two values a_i and b_i with 0<=a_i,b_i<=n-1.
Enforce a_i<b_i (for asymmetry and efficiency)
Also enforce a_{i-1}<a_i (for more efficiency)

Then, we need to encode the constraints:
- No two edges can intersect
- Every point must have at least two adjacent edges.
- the 180 degree rule


The adjacency list formuation:
We keep a list of 2m values, each of which will correspond to a half-edge index.
We also have n-1 indeces (we might not need these indeces)
The ith index denotes where the i+1th vertex's adjacency list starts.

Within our formulation of adjacency lists for each point (keep a variable for the degree)
and also sort by order of angle (which is both more efficient and quite useful)
Then for each incoming edge to a node,
assert that the next one (if it exists) is not too far over
It suffices to asser that angle increases through the big adjacency list,
except at the points where the next list starts.

To do this last part, we can create values v_first and v_last for each vertex v.
For v<n-1, v_end+1=(v+1)_start
of course, (n-1)_end=2m

Problem: how do we enforce angle constraints? How do we even get the appropriate x and y
We need something like angle_formula(x[val[i]],y[val[i]],x[val[i+1]],y[val[i+1]])

Edge intersection is still n^2. Can we do better?
Maybe we can formulate the events from bentley-ottmann (or an online algorithm?)


n^2 symbolic edge formulation:
Denote points 0 through n-1
Start with m edges 0 through m-1.

For each edge i, create two vertex variables ints:
u_i and v_i in the range [0,n-1].
u_i<v_i //lexicographical
Additionally, for every pair of edges i<j, say u_i<u_j // lexicographical

For every pair of edges i<j:
Verify they don't intersect

We have a list of 2m half-edge indeces d_j:
Every half-edge i in [0,2m-1] (0 to m-1 are u's, m to 2m-1 are v's) and adjanency index j in [0,2m-1]:
(i == d_j) => 


later:
For each edge i, create an "active" variable
a_i.
a_i=>a_{i-1} (a prefix of the edges are active)
min sum of a_i
